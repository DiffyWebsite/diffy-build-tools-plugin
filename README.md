# Diffy Terminus Build Tools plugin

Configures Diffy integration for Pantheon Drops 8 pull requests workflow.

Great to be run right after you have created a project https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/create-project.

You can run `terminus diffy:project:create` and it will request Diffy API key, project ID and set the integration for you.

Works with GitHub and CircleCI.
